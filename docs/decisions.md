## Chosen Language
I chose Java because it can give me the performance and scalability that I need for this project. Also, Java is a mature, robust, well structure, high tested and high adopted language.

## Test Coverage Report
I configured JaCoCo to generate the teste coverage report. It runs automatically after any push in the main branch. 
### Where do I find the report?
It can be downloaded on the action's coverage page, after a successful pipeline execution
